The Drought Severity Assessment Tool 2.0 (DSAT) is a decision support tool created for the Navajo Nation to allow water managers 
to generate Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) values specific to chosen boundaries within the Nation. 
The SPI is an index that compares accumulated rainfall during a specific period of time to accumulated rainfall during that specific time period throughout history. 


To get started, it is recommended that you first read through the manual for step-by-step instructions and more in-depth descriptions of the DSAT's functionalities.
The manual is located in the DSAT 2.0 folder. 

For a quick start-up
1) Ensure that the DSAT 2.0 folder are dragged to your computer's C:/ drive
2) Ensure that you have downloaded Rstudio version at least 3.3.0
3) Open the Open.R file (located in the DSAT 2.0 folder) within Rstudio
4) Click "Run App"
5) Continue with the installation instructions detailed in the manual

From there, you can
1) download the latest CHIRPS data
2) calculate SPI for a specific time period and time scale using the CHIRPS data
3) generate summary statistics for the SPI data
4) visualize the SPI data
